## ðŸ”´Checkers
___
The idea of the project is the implementation of the popular combinatorial game [Checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts), with additional variations.
The app offers the ability to play this game in three ways:

1. Normal mode - player vs player

2. Variation - player vs player: Each of the players has a number of hints determined at the beginning of the game. When a player calls a hint, he has the option to place the joker figure on one square on the board after the move, and make it unavailable for one move by the opponent. After that, the field is released and the game continues in the default variant.

3. Player vs Computer - the computer uses an algorithm to play moves

## ðŸ’» Languages and technologies
___
We used Scala programming language and Intellij IDEA environment to create our project. Scalafx was used to make the GUI.

## ðŸ“Ž Download and run the app
___
An executable version of the program can be found in the releases section. 
It is necessary to download the Checkers.jar file. Depending on the system, the program can be run as follows:
- Linux: through the terminal, you position yourself in the directory where the Checkers.jas file is saved and with the command 'java -jar Checkers.jar' we start the program.
- Windows: position yourself in the directory where the Checkers.jar file is saved and double-click on the file to start the program.

To run the program, you need to have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed on your computer.
